        h1 Alex Hipolito

        //- Feel free to personalize the title below

          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p By day, I design, code and maintain end-to-end and integration test automation scripts. I also use my technical skills, product knowledge and agile delivery experience to investigate and recommend solutions to incidents and customer problems. I am also an advocate for Web Accessibility. Whenever I have a spare moment, I even fix bugs.
          p By night, I take online courses to help me improve as a Developer and enjoy tinkering with side projects to put what I've learned into practice. I am currently undertaking the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.
          p Outside of digital life you can find me either running, lifting, playing tennis or baking (Banana Bread is my specialty!)
