          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I'm a Web Developer and QA Engineer based in Sydney with over 7 years of experience in coding, <s>breaking</s>testing and delivering core features to apps millions of Australians use everyday.
          p By day, I work at Aussie broadcaster SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) where I work on the website and APIs that support video streaming service SBS On Demand. SBS On Demand streams over 11,000+ hours of content to over 1 million active viewers per month for free. I design, build and maintain end-to-end and integration test automation scripts. I also use my technical skills, product knowledge and agile delivery experience to investigate and recommend solutions to incidents and customer problems. I am also an advocate for Web Accessibility. Whenever I have a spare moment, I even fix bugs.
          p By night, I take online courses to help me improve as a developer and enjoy tinkering with side projects to put what I've learned into practice.
          p Outside of digital life you can find me either running, bushwalking, lifting or baking (Banana Bread is my specialty!)
