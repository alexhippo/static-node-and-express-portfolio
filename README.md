# Static Node.js and Express Site

[View the demo](http://alexhippo.github.io/static-node-and-express-portfolio).

This project demonstrates server-side Javascript with Node.js and Express through a portfolio site for a web developer (me!). The site contains a modern landing page, an About page, and a series of project pages which show details of the last five Treehouse Techdegree projects I have worked on. This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).
