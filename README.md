# Static Node.js and Express Site

This project demonstrates server-side Javascript with Node.js and Express through a portfolio site for a web developer (me!) The site contains a modern landing page, an About page, and a series of project pages which show details of the last five Treehouse Techdegree projects I have worked on. This project was created as part of the [Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript).

## Customised styles
The following styles were changed from the original project:
- changed Heading, `p` and Sidebar Header font to Rubik
- changed Link and Body font to Roboto Mono
- changed background colour of body, sidebar and mobile view header to `#1d263b`
- changed sidebar font colour to `#FFFFFF`
- added hover transition of buttons to `#5c6784`
- added hover transition of project thumbnails from greyscale to coloured
- customised colours for active and visited links
- increased font size to a minimum of 16px for accessibility
- added keyboard focus outlines
- added an emoji favicon from [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/hippopotamus)
